## Overview

The problem: In their free time, UH students like to play various different games or take part in other activities. These can range from video games, board games, or outdoor activities such as hiking or playing sports. However, people may not have enough players to take part in these games, or may not know other people with these similar interests.

The solution: The Player Finder application allows students to find other students that share a similar interest in a particular game or activity. Students can show what categories of games and activities they have done or want to try, and can specify what particular games they are interested in for each category. Students can also score themselves according to their skill level, along with providing a short justification of why they ranked themselves accordingly.

## Mockup page ideas

After setting up a profile, students can then search for other players, either by sorting by the overall category (video game, board game, sport/physical activity), or by specific game or activity. Students can also sort by experience level if they want to find experienced players or are looking for new players.

Students can be contacted via their email (accounts should be made with their UH email), and from there can decide between each other on how they want to meet up or contact each other from that point.

Admins can add requested games to the database if they are not available to be selected, along with removing inappropriate or suspect entries and profiles.

Possible mockup pages include: 
- Landing page
- User home page
- Admin home page
- User profile page
- Category search (video game, board game, sport/physical activity)
- Search by specific game

## Use case ideas

Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

- New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile 
- Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits/curates site
- User goes to landing page, logs in, finds other player(s) with desired interest and experience in game or sport, contacts them
- User goes to landing page, logs in, adds new game(s) onto their profile, and then rates their skill level on each game

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

- User-made groups/clans
- Dedicated meet-up section
- Friends list
- Announcement/recruitment feature
