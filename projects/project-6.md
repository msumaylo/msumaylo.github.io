## Intro

This project was the second project for a VR/AR class taken in the fall of 2022. 

For this assignment, we were required to create a program that could be used on the CreateX lab, a system consisting of Microsoft Azure Kinect cameras and projectors that allowed users to interact using their movements.

More information on CreateX can be found [here](https://www.lavaflow.info/createx).

## Description

In this game, enemies are sent out from various directions. In the middle of the display area, the player model is present. By moving your arms and repositioning yourself in the playspace, you can move your player model around on the screen.

To hit enemies, you make your player chracter move so your arms or body make contact with the enemies. The game then also tracked the number of enemies you hit.
