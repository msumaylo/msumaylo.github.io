## Intro

This project was the final group project for a VR/AR class taken in Fall 2022. In this group project, we were given free reign to do whatever we wanted as long as we could interact with objects in the environment.

For this project, my group decided to make a simple 3D platformer game based on Mega Man.

## Description

In this game, you need to make it from the start of the level to the end of the level, all while trying to shoot the enemies placed throughout and without falling off the platforms.

Using the other buttons on the VR controllers, the player can also make use of a bomb weapon to clear blocks obstructing some areas of the map
