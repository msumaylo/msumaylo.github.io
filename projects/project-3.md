## Intro

<img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ICS111_project1_screenshot1.png">

Project 1/hawaiiFiveOhKaGofer is a simple collect-the-item “driving” game, created as my first project in ICS 111, Fall 2019. This was the first programming project I have ever done, created when I originally pursued mechanical engineering instead of computer science.

## Objective of the game

The objective of this game is simple: collect the items laid out throughout the map.

While doing so, avoid crashing into the people and buildings, otherwise game over.

## How I created the game

The game was created using the EZ.Java class, which provided various methods for moving and placing img, sound playback, and other features. The class was provided by the instructor of the course. For this first project, each person's submission had to meet some requirements, such as having a user controlled character/element, level elements to avoid and objects to collect. Aside from this, we were allowed to add in whatever we wanted to put in it. This was my first assignment where I made use of Java and the Eclipse IDE. 

Here is some brief gameplay footage (reducing video volume is recommended):
