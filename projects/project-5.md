## Intro

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/airattack_titlescreen.png">

Air Attack is a simple vertical shooting game created through Unity, created as a personal project to introduce myself to Unity during July 2022. Aside from going through Unity's official tutorials, this was my first project on the engine.

## Objective of the game

The objective of this game is to dodge the enemy aircraft and missiles, all while shooting down as many as you can.

The game keeps going until you either crash into an aircraft or missile.

## How I created the game

The game was created using Unity throughout July and early August 2022. During this time, I was also going through Unity's official tutorials, and applied the various aspects demonstrated in said tutorials. Scope was kept small with it being a first project, but may be improved upon as I gain familiarity with Unity. Assets were acquired from the Unity Asset Store.

Here is some brief gameplay footage:
